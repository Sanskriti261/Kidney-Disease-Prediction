# Kidney-Disease-Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Early detection is key for better patient care.  We leverage a dataset of health metrics, applying algorithms like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for accurate predictions. The project covers data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.
